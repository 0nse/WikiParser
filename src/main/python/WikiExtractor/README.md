# WikiCode Cleaner
This code is built upon @attardi's `WikiExtractor.py` (see down below for more information). The existing code already did a great job on removing WikiCode syntax from text in a sophisticated manner. However, it worked on Wikipedia dumps without processing revisions as needed for the WikiParser project. Thus, the modifications were applied and features were removed that are not needed for this project. In more detail, `WikiExtractor.py` has been stripped down as follows:

* No template expansion option.
* No compression option.
* No threading.
* No HTML output.
* No links preservation.
* Directly process text instead of working on dumps.
* Migrated the code from Python 2 to Python 3.
* Code cleanup (removed unused code and SoC).

## WikiExtractor.py
[WikiExtractor.py](http://medialab.di.unipi.it/wiki/Wikipedia_Extractor) is a Python script that extracts and cleans text from a [Wikipedia database dump](http://download.wikimedia.org/). The tool was written by [Giuseppe Attardi](https://github.com/attardi) and released under a GPLv3 licence. For further information, see the [project Home Page](http://medialab.di.unipi.it/wiki/Wikipedia_Extractor) or the [Wiki](https://github.com/attardi/wikiextractor/wiki).
